# kaleidoscope
Apply a kaleidoscope effect to images and videos.

Implements the functionality displayed in 
[this GIMP tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6Y9Yh4BM1Q), plus some extra
configurability.  
Test image is taken from that tutorial video for comparison.

## Running
Run `kaleidoscope.py` as a command-line script, or import the `kaleido` function to your
script and pass in an image and the relevant parameters.

### TODO
- Create an interactive example with opencv highgui to enable interactive changing of the
kaleidoscope parameters.
- Add [pythonic-cv](https://github.com/ES-Alexander/pythonic-cv) to enable an interactive
kaleidoscope effect in video playback.
